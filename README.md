Ola Bike Ride Request Forecasting
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project focuses on forecasting bike ride request demand for Ola using historical ride data. Accurate demand prediction helps ride-hailing platforms optimize driver allocation, pricing strategies, and operational efficiency.

The project applies regression-based machine learning models with time-based feature engineering to predict the number of ride requests.

DATASET DESCRIPTION:

The dataset contains historical Ola bike ride information, including:

* Datetime of ride requests

* Ride request count (target variable)

* Time-dependent patterns influencing demand

TECHNOLOGIES AND LIBRARIES USED:

* Python

* Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

* Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

* Scikit-learn – Modeling & evaluation

* XGBoost – Advanced regression

* Pickle – Model saving

PROJECT WORKFLOW:
1) Data Loading & Exploration

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Checked dataset structure, summary statistics, and missing values
2) Data Cleaning

* Missing numeric values filled using median
* Non-numeric missing values handled using forward fill
3) Feature Engineering

Extracted time-based features from the datetime column:
* Hour
* Day
* Month
* Year
These features capture temporal demand patterns.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
* Visualized demand trends across time
* Identified peak and off-peak demand periods

TRAIN-TEST SPLIT:
* Dataset split into training and testing sets
* Feature scaling applied where required

MODELS IMPLEMENTED:
1) Linear Regression:
* Used as a baseline regression model
* Applied feature scaling before training

2) Random Forest Regressor:
* Captures non-linear demand patterns
* Hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV

3) XGBoost Regressor:
* Gradient boosting-based regression model
* Designed to improve prediction accuracy on structured data

MODEL EVALUATION METRICS:
Models were evaluated using:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* R² Score
These metrics measure prediction accuracy and model reliability.

MODEL SAVING:
* The trained model was saved using Pickle
* Enables reuse of the model without retraining

KEY OUTCOMES:
* Time-based features significantly improved demand prediction

* Tree-based models outperformed linear regression

* The approach effectively captures ride demand trends

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
* Incorporate external factors (weather, holidays, events)

* Apply time-series-specific models (ARIMA, LSTM)

* Deploy the model as a real-time prediction API
